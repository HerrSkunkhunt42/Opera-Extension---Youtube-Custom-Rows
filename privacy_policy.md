Privacy Policy for YouTube Custom Rows Extension
Effective Date: 05.10.2024
This Privacy Policy describes how the YouTube Custom Rows extension handles the user’s data. By using this extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information Collection and Use
The YouTube Custom Rows extension does not collect or transmit any personal information from users. No personal or sensitive data is sent to external servers, nor is it shared with third parties.

2. Permissions
This extension uses the following permissions:

  Storage Permission: The extension uses the chrome.storage API to store the value that controls the number of rows in the YouTube grid layout. This value is stored locally on the user’s device to ensure the extension remembers the user's preference between browser sessions.

  Active Tab Permission: The extension uses the activeTab permission to modify the active YouTube tab by injecting CSS that adjusts the number of grid rows displayed. This permission only operates when YouTube is actively in use and does not collect personal data from the user’s browsing session.

3. Data Usage
Locally Stored Data: The only data stored is the counter value that adjusts the number of rows displayed in YouTube's grid layout. This data is stored locally on your browser and is never transmitted to any server.
CSS Injection: The extension dynamically injects CSS into YouTube pages to adjust the display of content. This CSS injection only affects the appearance of YouTube's layout and does not collect or modify any personal data.

4. Data Sharing
The extension does not share any data with external parties. All operations are performed locally on the user’s device, and no information is sent to any third-party servers or services.

5. Security
I prioritize your privacy and security. The extension does not access, collect, or store sensitive data. All information related to the counter is kept on your device, and no data is shared or transmitted.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify users by updating the date at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for any updates.
